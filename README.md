## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Certain speedcubers work tirelessly to framecount the fastest solves and compile
this data for the benefit of the speedcubing community. However I found that
there was no tool to view the data besides either uploading it straight to [reco.nz](https://reco.nz/solve/index)
or using a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pcjfR9wVz-_-oHm6vI88px4bRUT6ajEYanEVUSzt6cY/edit?gid=1709714197#gid=1709714197)

I often found myself wanting to reconstruct and framecount solves and view/share
the data I saw, however the solves I wanted to reconstruct were often not fast enough
to be uploaded to the db, so I decided to make my own formatting tool.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the `pnpm` package manager installed. 

```
sudo pacman -S pnpm
```

### Installing
Install all dependencies first

```
pnpm install
```

then run the development server :)

```
pnpm run dev
```

<!-- End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo. -->
